# Instructlab Workbenches

Ready to use OpenShift AI custom workbench image, with fully included [InstructLab](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/tree/main) 0.21.0  and Code Server 4.95.3, and CUDA acceleration.

This image can be used in OpenShift AI or locally using Podman if you have an NVidia GPU.

_Note: in this release, the Jupyter image is deprecated as it's easier to use Code server (VSCode) in an InstructLab context. However an older version with InstructLan 0.18.4 can be found [here](https://quay.io/repository/rh-aiservices-bu/instructlab-workbench-jupyter-cuda)_
